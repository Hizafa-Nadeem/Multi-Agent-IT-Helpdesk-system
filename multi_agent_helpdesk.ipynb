Confirmation: \\no A confirmation message will indicate that your password has been successfully \\nreset. \\no You can now use your new password to log in to your account. \\n3.2 Best Practices for Password Security \\nTo maintain the security of your account, adhere to the following best practices: \\n• Create Strong Passwords: \\no Use a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special \\ncharacters. \\no Avoid using easily guessable information such as birthdays, common words, or \\nsequences (e.g., \"password123\" or \"abcd1234\"). \\n• Unique Passwords: \\no Do not reuse passwords across multiple accounts. Each account should have a \\nunique password to prevent a compromise of one account leading to others being \\ncompromised. \\n• Regular Updates: \\no Change your password periodically, at least every 90 days, to enhance security. \\n• Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): \\no Whenever possible, enable MFA for an additional layer of security.

Confirmation: \\no A confirmation message will indicate that your password has been successfully \\nreset. \\no You can now use your new password to log in to your account. \\n3.2 Best Practices for Password Security \\nTo maintain the security of your account, adhere to the following best practices: \\n• Create Strong Passwords: \\no Use a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special \\ncharacters. \\no Avoid using easily guessable information such as birthdays, common words, or \\nsequences (e.g., \"password123\" or \"abcd1234\"). \\n• Unique Passwords: \\no Do not reuse passwords across multiple accounts. Each account should have a \\nunique password to prevent a compromise of one account leading to others being \\ncompromised. \\n• Regular Updates: \\no Change your password periodically, at least every 90 days, to enhance security. \\n• Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): \\no Whenever possible, enable MFA for an additional layer of security. This typically \\ninvolves a second verification step, such as a code sent to your phone. \\n• Secure Storage: \\no Utilize a reputable password manager to securely store and manage your \\npasswords. Avoid writing them down or storing them in unsecured documents. \\n3.3 Troubleshooting and Support \\nIf you encounter any issues during the password reset process or have not enrolled in the SSPR \\nsystem, please contact the IT Help Desk for assistance: \\n• Email: helpdesk@company.com\\n  \\n• Phone: (123) 456-7890\\n  \\n• Hours of Operation: Monday to Friday, 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM \\nBy following these guidelines and utilizing the SSPR portal, you can efficiently manage your \\npassword resets and maintain the security of your account.'"
